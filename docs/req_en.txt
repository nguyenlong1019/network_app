1. Assignment 1: Develop a Network Application
Objective:

Create a simplified torrent-like application using a specified protocol within the TCP/IP protocol stack.
Overview:

The application will have a centralized server that keeps track of connected clients and stores information 
about file pieces available on those clients.
The Tracker Protocol: Clients notify the server about the files in their local repository 
without transferring the actual file data.
When a client requests a file not present in its local storage, 
it sends a request to the server, which helps identify another client holding that file.
The design requires the client code to be multithreaded to support simultaneous downloads from multiple peers.
Key Components:

Magnet Text: Contains essential information like a hash code pointing to a metainfo file on the tracker portal.
Metainfo File: (.torrent file) Details the torrent, including the file location, piece length, and count.
Pieces: The file is divided into equal-sized parts (commonly 512KB) for efficient downloading.
Files: The files are mapped to pieces, and managing this mapping is critical for accuracy.
Tracker HTTP Protocol:
Clients contact the tracker to register information about their file pieces.
The tracker provides responses based on specified parameters and requests, 
helping facilitate peer-to-peer file sharing.
2. Assignment 2: Network Design and Simulation for a Critical Large Hospital
Objective:

Design a comprehensive network topology for a large hospital, 
covering different departments and ensuring efficient and secure data exchange.
Case Study:

The CCC Agency is tasked with designing a network for a large hospital with two main buildings (A and B), 
each with 5 floors containing 10 rooms equipped with medical devices and computers.
Data Center: Located in a separate room for IT management.
Specifications:
600 workstations, 10 servers, and at least 12 networking devices with a focus on security.
Wireless coverage must be available throughout the site.
New Technologies: The network will use advanced infrastructure technologies like fiber cabling and GigaEthernet.
WAN Connection: The main site connects to two auxiliary sites via leased lines, 
potentially using technologies like SD-WAN or MPLS.
Internet Access: Utilizes xDSL connections with load balancing.
Software: The hospital will use a combination of licensed and open-source software for various purposes, 
including patient records and multimedia applications.
Requirements:
Must ensure scalability, high security (including phishing detection), high availability (HA), and system robustness.
VPN Configuration: Proposed for secure remote access.
Surveillance systems and other enhancements for comprehensive security and reliability.
